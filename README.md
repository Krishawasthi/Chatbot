# Articlebot
A Chatbot AI developed using the Python programming language is an intelligent system designed to simulate human-like conversation through text or voice. Python is widely used for building chatbots due to its simplicity, vast library ecosystem, and strong support for machine learning and natural language processing (NLP).
Such a chatbot can perform tasks like answering questions, providing recommendations, or generating content based on user input. It typically integrates models like  LLaMA, Mistral, Gemma or custom-trained models, and may use frameworks like Streamlit, Flask, or Gradio for the frontend interface.
The instructions to run the chatbot are :
1 - The local host must have Ollama installed.
2 - 3 models are been used in the Ollama.
3 - To run those models the following commands are used:
 i. Ollama pull llama.
 ii. Ollama pull mistral.
 iii. Ollama pull gemma.
4 - Streamlit is used to run the chatbot. 
5 - To run the chatbot locally "Streamlit run chatbot.py" command is used in the terminal.
